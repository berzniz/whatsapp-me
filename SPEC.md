- **Calendar Compatibility**: Create events that work with standard calendar applications
- **Duration Management**: Apply sensible default durations or extract specified timeframes
- **Event Completeness**: Include source context and relevant details

### 6. Event Distribution
- **Automated Sharing**: Send event summaries to designated group or contacts
- **Multiple Formats**: Provide both text summaries and calendar files
- **Source Attribution**: Identify where the event information originated
- **Easy Calendar Addition**: Enable recipients to quickly add events to their calendars

### 7. Configuration Management
- **Flexible Setup**: Allow customization of monitoring scope and behavior
- **Privacy Controls**: Control which conversations are monitored
- **Target Configuration**: Specify where event notifications are sent
- **Optional Filtering**: Choose specific chats or contacts to monitor

### 8. Reliability and Error Handling
- **Robust Operation**: Continue functioning despite temporary issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality when components fail
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatically restore normal operation after problems
- **Data Protection**: Preserve user data and session information
